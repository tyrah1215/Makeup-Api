# Project
I created this project to help practice my understanding of api integration. Using "https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com", Makeup-Api, I analyzed various types of makeup products using data fetched. It provides insights into the pricing of different makeup products by comparing low-end and high-end products based on their average prices and displays ratings. I averaged each of the categories, then created functions based off of their averages. High-end products would be products higher than the average, and low-end products being lower than the average price. My project is implemented in Python and uses the requests library to fetch data and pandas to process and display the data in a readable format. 

Main skills I wanted to highlight: API Integration, Data Processing, Data Analysis, Error Handling, Data Visualization

A fun way as a makeup lover to learn api integration and practice my python!
